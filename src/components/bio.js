      	<p>Ominous and nostalgic, Orphan King’s music plunges into his offbeat troubled past, surfacing with dismal themes of religion, hope, betrayal, sexuality, and family. His sound is tinged with narrative texture, a sleepy viscous cadence that seems to bleed into itself. Fusing warped drenched vocals that take the backseat to their analog synthetic counterparts. The music is an odyssey worth exploring, but the real story is revealed in the silence in between. Orphan King is the moniker of Stockholm based Ryan Pittman.</p>
      	<p>He grew up in a grim religious net, void of normal life. Eventually his father pulled him out at the expense of losing their family. They hit the road, moving around numerous times before finally settling down in Los Angeles. The battle with abusive piety and his ephemeral living conditions had a huge impact on his life and can subliminally be heard in his music.</p>
      	<p>He leaned towards music at a young age. As young as 7, he was fixated to artists like The Cure, Bauhaus and Pink Floyd. He picked up his first guitar at 13, formed a handful of hardcore bands, though none of them really took off. It was the rave scene, and underground Los Angeles parties and later his years in Berlin that ultimately drove him towards electronic music. Though he never really fit into these groups, he loved the anonymity of the scene: economy, sexuality and dogma we’re suppressed. Music was the only doctrine here.</p>
      	<p>While in university, he continued working on smaller music projects and had a few residencies at local clubs in San Francisco. Though his past caught up with him and in fear of becoming stagnant, he sold and gave away everything he owned and bought a one-way ticket to Europe. Over the next several years his music exploration was parallelled with his design career in places like Belfast, Budapest, Berlin and Stockholm. </p>
      	<p>In 2016, after years in design, he turned his focus to making music again. Over the next two years he would develop his sound, challenging and channeling his painful past. Rising from the ashes, Orphan King was materialized. In 2018 he released his debut EP called Witness. Jan 2019 he announced “Kids” a 3-part album that will be released over the year.</p>
